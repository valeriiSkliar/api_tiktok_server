# Detailed Integration Plan for Mail Server Functionality

## 1. Architecture Overview

The goal is to integrate the mail server functionality directly into the TikTok authentication service, removing the dependency on the external API. We'll implement this by:

- Creating a direct mail service that connects to the mail server (IMAP)
- Implementing a database service for storing verification codes
- Ensuring the new implementation conforms to the existing interfaces

## 2. Component Structure

### 2.1. Core Services

#### EmailService: Direct replacement for EmailApiService

- Will connect directly to IMAP server
- Will handle email retrieval and verification code extraction
- Will maintain compatibility with IEmailVerificationHandler interface

#### EmailDatabaseService: For storing and managing verification codes

- Will use SQLite for persistence (like the original implementation)
- Will handle code status tracking (used/unused)

### 2.2. Models

#### EmailCode: TypeScript model for verification codes

- Will mirror the structure of the existing JavaScript model

### 2.3. Utilities

#### EmailParser: For extracting verification codes from email content

- Will implement the regex patterns from the original implementation

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure

- Create database configuration for SQLite
- Set up environment variable handling for email credentials
- Create the EmailCode model in TypeScript

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation

#### Implement EmailDatabaseService

- Database initialization
- CRUD operations for verification codes
- Status management functions

#### Implement EmailService

- IMAP connection handling
- Email retrieval functions
- Verification code extraction
- Integration with database service

### Phase 3: Integration with Existing Code

- Update TikTokEmailVerificationHandler to use the new EmailService
- Ensure compatibility with the IEmailVerificationHandler interface
- Update any factory methods that create email verification handlers

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- Test email connection and retrieval
- Test verification code extraction
- Test the full authentication flow with email verification

## 4. Dependencies Required

- **ImapFlow**: For IMAP connection and email retrieval
- **Sequelize**: For database ORM
- **SQLite3**: For database storage

## 5. Configuration Requirements

- Email server credentials (already in .env)
- Database path configuration
- Logging configuration

## 6. Migration Strategy

1. Implement the new services alongside the existing EmailApiService
2. Create a feature flag to switch between implementations
3. Once the new implementation is validated, remove the API-based implementation

## 7. Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Maintaining session state across application restarts

**Solution**: Persist session information in the database

### Challenge 2: Handling email format changes from TikTok

**Solution**: Implement multiple regex patterns and fallback mechanisms

### Challenge 3: Managing email connection failures

**Solution**: Implement retry mechanisms and connection pooling

### Challenge 4: Ensuring thread safety for database operations

**Solution**: Use proper transaction handling and connection management
